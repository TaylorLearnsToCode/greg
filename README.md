# GREG - Guided Random Encounter Generator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.4.

Its purpose is to help with the automated generation of dungeons, dungeon encounters, wildernesses, and wilderness encounters in Old School or OSR games.

## License

This project is under the TST (Totally Steal This) License.

If you want to use it, fork it, whatever: do it. A link back would be nice, but I... don't care. Any way that the software makes your game better? That's the purpose of the software - the fact that it's making your game better means it's served it's purpose.

Will try to load an official license file eventually.
